  longDescription: Dependency-Track is an intelligent Component Analysis platform
    that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain.
    Dependency-Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the
    capabilities of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities
    that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.
    Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application
    in its portfolio in order to proactively identify risk across an organization.
    The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in CI/CD environments.
